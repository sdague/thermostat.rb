    # This is the user setable mode for what state the thermostat is
    # in.  This could be one of Off, Heat, Cool, or Auto.  These
    # really mean which setback values the thermostat is going to pay
    # attention to.  
    #
    # In Off, obviously, it ignores them all.  In Heat mode, it only
    # cares if you are below SetbackHeat.  In Cool mode, it only cares
    # if you are above SetbackCool.  In Auto mode it will both heat
    # and cool to keep within some target range.
    #
    # Unless you are storing great works of art, Auto mode is
    # overkill, and probably going to cost you a lot of money on
    # Spring and Fall days.
